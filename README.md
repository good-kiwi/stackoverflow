## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using AirBNB data from Boston to better understand:

1. What neighborhoods are the highest grossing units in?
2. What type of property is the most popular to rent?
3. Does having more reviews imply less vacancy?
4. Can we predict appropriate rental prices in the Boston market?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

Data exploration, cleansing, and model building is done in the .py file

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@joseph.cal/placeholder-for-airbnb-results-9d8affcc71b7).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Data belongs to AirBNB and is publicly available [here](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html)
